## Differences with the Original Game

Due to time limitations, we have replicated  the basic gameplay (launching, flippers, map) plus the principal bumpers and a few combo elements.

Our game presents a way of obtaining extra balls by reaching a certain score. Also we could not find the original audio other from the background music, but we have replaced them with new sounds that matches all the interactions (bumpers, flippers, refill, lost ball etc...)
